When all instances in the same configuration terminated, download the logs by

```{bash}
cd logs
bash download_stdout_log.sh
```

And analyze logs using the scripts [`analysis.sh`](analysis.sh) and [`analysis_bandwidth.sh`](analysis_bandwidth.sh). Instructions to use these scripts are documented in [Analyze raw logs](../../README.md#analyze-raw-logs-05-compute-minutes).

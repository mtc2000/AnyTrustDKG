This folder contains auxiliary scripts that

- check status of existing EC2 instances;
- force terminate EC instances;
- rerun a given number of instances in case some instances take way longer than expected time to be ready.

Some scripts may not work properly, or works better if copied to [`run`](../run/). Please use with caution.
For usage, please refer to comments in each script.
